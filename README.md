                                             2WD Arduino Avoiding Robot Car
                                                          
Specification:

1) The DC motor is drive by using an L298N motor driver and power up with 2 9V cell battery separately, for the Arduino board and L298N motor driver shield.

2) Using SR-HC04 ultrasonic sensor and SG90 servo motor to drive the eye-sight. 

3) The Arduino Uno is connect with Arduino Sensor Shield v5.0.

4) I will provide the schematic in the Projects tab above (feel free to look at it).
